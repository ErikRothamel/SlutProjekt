                <h1>My Experience</h1>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Stockholm University – Bachelor’s in Photography & Visual Arts
2017 – 2020  
My formal education in photography began at Stockholm University, where I studied the art and technical aspects of visual storytelling. Through courses in composition, lighting, digital post-production, and documentary photography, I developed a strong foundation in both creative expression and commercial photography. My studies also included film photography and darkroom techniques, giving me a deep appreciation for the traditional roots of the craft.  </p>
<p>
    Advanced Photography Workshop – National Academy of Arts, Sweden  
2021  
To further refine my skills, I completed an intensive workshop focusing on portrait and editorial photography, where I worked with professional models and industry-leading photographers. This experience helped me master studio lighting, creative direction, and high-end photo retouching.  
</p>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<p>From the moment I picked up my first camera, photography has been more than just a profession—it’s my way of capturing emotions and telling stories. Over the past several years, I’ve worked across various genres, from intimate portrait sessions to large-scale commercial shoots, each experience shaping me as a creative professional.  </p>

<p>Freelance Photographer | 2020 – Present

My work has spanned across fashion, product photography, and travel photography, always with an emphasis on capturing authenticity and visual storytelling. Some highlights include:

    - Working with local and international brands to develop visual marketing campaigns. 
</p>

</p>

<p>Studio Photographer at Nordic Creative Agency | 2021 – 2023

</p>
<p>- Studio lighting setups for professional campaigns.</p>
<p>- High-end retouching and editing for commercial clients.  </p>
<p>- Creative direction, working closely with models and stylists to bring brand visions to life.  </p>

My photography has been featured in Scandinavian Photography Magazine, Creative Stockholm, and The Visual Storyteller. Additionally, my work has been showcased in two gallery exhibitions in Stockholm, focusing on street photography and urban landscapes.  </p>

<b>My Approach:</b>

<p>I believe that great photography is about more than just taking a picture—it’s about capturing a moment, a feeling, and a perspective. Whether working with clients, brands, or on personal projects, my goal is always to create images that are both visually striking and emotionally engaging.  </p>
